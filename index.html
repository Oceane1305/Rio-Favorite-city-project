    <h2 class="blue">Reasons Why you should visit Rio de Janeiro</h2>
    
    <p>Rio de Janeiro's setting between the mountains and the sea is so spectacular that UNESCO cited "the staggeringly beautiful location for one of the world's biggest cities" in naming Rio a World Heritage Site.</p>
    
    <p>Rio is a city that impresses with its nature and famous beaches likeCopacabana,the most popular and fun. It is a city that overflows with nature at every turn and there isn't a day that goes by that it isn't animated, whether by locals or tourists who visit it throughout the year.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to its beautiful landscape, its waves and its sunny afternoons, you can do many sports in its sandy grounds. Volleyball>, football or even frescobol, are some of the many options you have to have a good time and to move a little.</p>
    <p>You can also come and enjoy its music such as samba, which can be heard in all the bars, or "Bossa Nova", which never goes out of style. Rio brings you joy with every step you take and helps you let go, have more fun and dare to dance to new rhythms. It is impossible not to let yourself be carried away by the rhythm of the music.</p>

    <p>It is especially between February and March that one of the most beautiful shows in the world takes place: The Carnival of Rio! There are no others like this. The streets are crowded from the start and no one stays home. The party is in all the streets, everyone dresses up, dances and follows a route with no specific destination.

            <p>With its white sandy beaches, soaring mountains and picturesque harbor, it’s no wonder that Rio de Janeiro is known as the “cidade maravilhosa”, or marvelous city. Facing the South Atlantic coast, the second-largest city in Brazil is blessed with one of the most beautiful natural settings for a metropolis in the world.</p>
            
            <p>Depending on how much time you have to visit Rio, you may need to make some choices:</p>
            
            <ul>
                
            <li>Take the cable car to <emphasis>Sugar Loaf.</emphasis> The view at the top over the entire bay of Rio is breathtaking</li>

            <h2>Museum of Tomorrow</h2>
            
            <p>What I really like about this Meuseum is the way it has been acted as an example of how public buildings can be sustainable as well as functional. The Museum of Tomorrow definitely is one of the most amazing and recommended museums to visit in Brazil, whether you are into science and technology or not.  I highly recommend a visit if you ever have a chance to go to Rio de Janeiro</p>
            
            <p>The museum of Tomorrow is a science museum designed by neofuturistic architect Santiago Calatrava and built next to the Guanabara Bay at Pier Maua. It mixes science with an innovative design to focus on sustainable cities and an ecological world. The project has sustainability as one of its priorities and had its environmental impacts significantly reduced; some of the sustainable initiatives include reduction and correct disposal of waste (the reuse of leftovers from the foundation stakes for the construction), solar panels installed in the roof that move with the sun to maximize energy absorption, the collection of reusable rainwater, and use of the waters of Guanabara Bay in the air conditioning system (this water is then filtered, cleaned and returned back to the Bay), resulting in water savings of about 25 L per day. The museum saves up to almost 50% energy compared to conventional buildings. Due to its unique design, use of local resources and innovative exhibits, the museum received “Best Innovative Green Building</p>

            <p> Characterized by a rather arresting organic building with an elongated roof jutting out over Praca Maua, this science museum focuses on sustainability through ideas rather than objects. The main exhibition space is largely digital, and leads visitors down a hall that explores our origins and potential futures</p>

            <h2>National Museum of Fine Arts</h2>
          
            <p> The <emphasis>National Museum of Fine Arts </emphasis> is a beautiful museum that holds one of the most important and complete collections of Brazilian art in Brazil, with a total of around 20,000 different forms of painting, sculptures and prints on public display. Brazilian paintings and sculptures from the 1800s make up the bulk of the collection, whilst smaller exhibitions are dedicated to Brazilian folk art and African art. I am a really fan of Arts, so it would be nice to visit this Museum which is full of differents paintings, made by the great Brazilian painters </p>

            <p> The large collection of the National Museum of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro includes more than 18,000 pieces of painting, sculpture and engravings. On the ground floor there are two long sculpture galleries where you can see plaster reproductions of famous pieces found in the main museums of Europe and that were made by the students of the School of Fine Arts. An original marble bust representing Antinoo, dating from the second century is the main piece of the room.

            <p>On the top floor of the museum is the huge gallery of Brazilian art of the nineteenth century where paintings and sculptures of national and foreign artists are exhibited. Among the most important works are Victor Meireles’ paintings «The first Mass in Brazil» which was the first work of a Brazilian artist to be exhibited at the Paris Motor Show, in 1861 and, «The Battle of the Guararapes» that represents the fight against the Dutch in Pernambuco.</p>

            <p><emphasis>Copacabana</emphasis> is easily on top of the list of the best beaches in Rio de Janeiro – it is where most visitors make their way to for soaking in the warmth of the South American tropics, engaging in a host of beach and water sports, and partying on after sunsets. Copacabana stretches for around 4 km and is divided into several sections. Copacabana is a great Rio seaside for experiencing the local beach life with favorite pastimes of beach volley and beach soccer. There are plenty of beach bars and kiosks along its length where you can refresh, and where you can expect spontaneous parties with live shows thrown throughout the day.</p>
            
            <p>The interesting part is how crowded the beach could be all day. It is a with crystal turquoise water and pure golden fine sand, so you don't need special shoes. The sharpness of entering the water is quite normal. This beach is suitable for different categories of people, lonely travellers, relaxation getaway lovers, seniors etc. It is very crowded place during the season.</p>

        <p> <emphasis>The Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro</emphasis> is considered one of the most important and richest of the world. The Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden is famous for the exuberance and the scientific importance of its plant collection, as well as for the beauty of its landscapes. Its bicentennial history is expressed in its monuments, buildings and artworks.</p>

        <p>What I really love about this Garden is how the visitors can walk along the alleys or rent an electric car to see plants from all over the world, visit the greenhouses (Orchids, Bromeliads, Ferns, Insectivorous Plants) and the thematic collections and gardens</p>
